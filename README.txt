Please install numpy, scipy, sklearn and pandas before to run our code.

We split each train data into two equal parts. Each part contains 2500 instances.
Then we use one part to train our classifier and the other part to test it.

We use adaboost classifier in our project.
the ROC area for appetency is 0.79 
the ROC area for churn is 0.71
